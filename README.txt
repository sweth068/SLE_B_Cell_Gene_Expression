##README

This project focuses on exploring gene expression data from peripheral B lymphocytes in patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and healthy controls. The goal is to use R for basic data manipulation, data visualization, and statistical analysis.

The visualizations help in understanding the differences between SLE patients and healthy controls in terms of gene expression.
